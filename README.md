# Delta Sandbox

An online compiler frontend for the [Delta programming language](https://github.com/delta-lang/delta).
A live instance is running [here](https://delta-lang.github.io/delta-sandbox).

This frontend simply sends the submitted code to the backend to be compiled
and run. The [backend server](https://github.com/delta-lang/delta-sandbox-backend)
is deployed on Heroku.

## Usage

To run the frontend locally, just open the [index.html](index.html) file in a
web browser.
